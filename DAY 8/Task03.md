Task: Compare list.append(x) VS list.insert(0, x)

Explanation: Here user input has been taken for both appending and inserting a number in list.
.append(element) used here for appending a number at last in the list.
And .insert(index no,element) used here for inserting a number at index no (for example 0).When inserting a number at designated index all existing numbers move one step forward.
